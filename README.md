My 51st assignment! This one was an intro to typescript, creating different small components to show my ability to work with some of the new features of it.

Assignment 1  
I created a component to render a string, list of numbers, and the sum of two numbers on the page. This was done with typescript and rendered as a functional component.  

Assignment 2  
I created a component named ColorList that renders a predefined array of colors(strings) within the component.  

Next, I created a function to filter numbers so that only the even are returned, and I rendered this onto the page in its own component.  

Lastly, I created a component called UserList to render an array of user objects. Each object was made to be of a custom type which validated the data that was made using it.
